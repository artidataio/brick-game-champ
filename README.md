This is a small project to showcase my understanding of ReactJS.
It's an old school snake game with 2D array implementation combine with SVG.
The game is deployed in AWS Amplify and accessible via this link: https://master.dmd66awrlo3rm.amplifyapp.com/.
It is also hosted in Netlify as a backup:  https://pedantic-jones-73aaeb.netlify.app/
